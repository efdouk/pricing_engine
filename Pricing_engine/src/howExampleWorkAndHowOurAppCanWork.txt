database holds all orders and items
the engine is created - it has all db items injected and the clips source loaded.

the input data is injected to engine, then the engine is run and the objects are retrieved from the engine

- all cars are injected
- the user preferences are injected and are being parsed by the engine
- the engine returns the 20 most suitable cars SORTED by the wanted rules (sorting may be the tricky part)

-----------------------------------------
There are three steps of reasoning. Lets make then the three separate clips files to handle those steps.

Each step takes a bunch of items and filters them or rates them, for example:
1 step
- sort cars by the important criterions
- filter them by type
- return the list
2 step
- filter by the criterions

-----------------------------------------
first step of selection
-----------------------------------------

 - 3 most important criterions
 	[ criterium           | v ]
 	 | comfort            |
 	 | performance        |
	 | handling			  |
	 | economy            |
	 | quality            |
